# Nat King Cole – ラヴ

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
L is for the way you look at me
O if for the only one I see
V is very very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone
that you adore can love
It's all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a
game for two
Two in love can make it
Take my heart
but please don't break it
Love was made for me and you
L is for the way you look at me
O if for the only one I see
V is very very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone
that you adore can love
It's all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a
game for two
Two in love can make it
Take my heart
but please don't break it
Love was made for me and you
Love was made for me and you
Love was made for me and you
