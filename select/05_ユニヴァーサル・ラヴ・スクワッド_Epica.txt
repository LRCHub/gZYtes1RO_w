We are the ones to change the world now
Still in control of all machinery
We claim the right to pull the trigger and damage
Your image of honor

Inventing
Improving
Creating
Existence
Embrace the technological remedy

Robotic legions stand in line to carry out
The retribution and effects of this advanced technology
New inventions have to pay
To fight their way
To judgment day
To judgment day

We are the ones that rule the world now
You are entrapped by blind inanity
There is no way that you'll revoke your decision
Now look for distraction

Inventing
Improving
Creating
Existence
Embrace the technological elegy

Robotic legions stand in line to carry out
The retribution and effects of this advanced technology
New inventions have to pay
To fight their way
To judgment day
To judgment day

I am forever the snake devouring its tail
In search of eternity

Robotic legions stand in line to carry out
The retribution and effects of this advanced technology
New inventions have to pay
To fight their way
To judgment day
To judgment day
