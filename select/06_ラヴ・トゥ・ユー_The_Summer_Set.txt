You were made for me, I was made for you
Just one touch, we stuck like glue
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, la love
You were there for me, I was there for you
Got stuck in a hole and we dug ourselves through
We always do, we always do, no, no
Our kind of love don't break or bend
I'll hold you till the whole world ends, oh it ends
Because you and I could be the best of friends, ohh, oh
Yea, you and I could be the best of friends
'Cause no matter what I do, my heart beats for two
Always give my L-O-V-E-T-O-Y-O-U
Our hearts drum like pots and pans
I'm the conductor, you're the marching band
When you hold my hand, you hold my hand, la, love
We stick together like cellophane
Gimme a straight jacket, I love you insane
Oh, I will, you know I will
You and I could be the best of friends, ohh, oh
Yea, you and I could be the best of friends
'Cause no matter what I do, my heart beats for two
Always give my L-O-V-E-T-O-Y-O-U
My L-O-V-E-T-O-Y-O-U
And when the world comes crashing down
We'll dance at the speed of sound, oh girl
There ain't nothing I won't do for you, ohh, oh
I hope you know
That you and I could be the best of friends, ohh, oh
Yea, you and I could be the best of friends
No matter what I do, my heart beats for two
Always give my L-O-V-E-T-O-Y-O-U
My L-O-V-E-T-O-Y-O-U
My L-O-V-E-T-O-Y-O-U
